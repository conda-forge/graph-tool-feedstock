  summary: |
    Graph-tool is an efficient Python module for manipulation and statistical analysis of graphs (a.k.a. networks).
    The 'graph-tool' conda package installs graph-tool and all dependencies, including drawing dependencies.
    For users who don't need drawing support, the 'graph-tool-base' conda package installs graph-tool and
    only essential dependencies (but none for drawing).
