  # conda-build 3.18.12 uses LIEF instead of patchelf,
  # which may be causing problems for this recipe.
  # We can force it to use patchelf with this setting.
  # There might be other bugs related to LIEF, too:
  # - https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/10979#issuecomment-595388237
  # - https://github.com/lief-project/LIEF/issues/239
  # 
  # (Maybe this setting won't be needed in a later version of conda-build.)

  summary: |
    Graph-tool is an efficient Python module for manipulation and statistical analysis of graphs (a.k.a. networks).
    The 'graph-tool' conda package installs graph-tool and all dependencies, including drawing dependencies.
    For users who don't need drawing support, the 'graph-tool-base' conda package installs graph-tool and
    only essential dependencies (but none for drawing).
